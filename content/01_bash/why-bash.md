# Why Bash?

The shell is a tool that can be intimidating for first time users, but is used throughout scientific programming. In this chapter, you will learn the basics of shell navigation, file editing and scripting to reduce any shell anxiety you may have!


## Talking to your computer at a low level

If you have mainly used a Windows or Mac computer your whole life like me, you might get a tightness in your chest every time you see something like this:

Even though the pretty graphical user interfaces we're used to using are excellent for most things, the plain old shell can be your best friend if we can get over the anxiety of using it. The motivation for making this part of the course is 3-fold:

1) As someone who is interested in scientific coding, you will probably encounter a shell promt at some point (maybe you have already). Might as well get over the shell angst now while we're all learning!

2) Working in the shell makes things like version control with Git much easier (stay tuned until lesson1 for my motivation behind making Git a part of this course). 

3) Using the shell makes you look like a total hacker!
