# Lament not, ye weary and burdened Windows users
There are many ways to get access to a bash shell on Windows. 

| Option                | Pros   | Cons |
| --------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------- |
| Run a *Virtual Machine* (VM) | Keep using Windows, but run Linux run in a window. | Slow to emulate Linux in a program, can also require an expensive license. |
| Dual-boot Windows and Linux | Get full Linux experience using PC's full computing power and memory. | Requires you to reserve space for another OS on your hard drive. Also, messing with your hard drive runs the risk of corrupting it. |
| Linux in the cloud (Google Cloud / Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure) | Accessible from anywhere, can request more resources as you need them. | More technical to setup. Generally charges by the hour which can get costly. |
| *Windows 10 only*: Windows Subsystem for Linux | Setup is easy and free. Best integrated with Windowns (easy to access files on your PC) | Still in development, but I've been using it for ~1 yr and *it just works*. |
