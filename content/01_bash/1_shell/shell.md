### Terminal? Command line? Shell? Bash?

I've thrown the word shell around a lot, so let's take a quick step back to understand what we'll be doing.

Every click, scroll, and letter typed on your computer gets translated to a basic language of 0s and 1s that your computer can understand. While we won't be learning binary for this course, nor should you ever have to, we will learn to talk to the computer on a slightly lower level that we might be used to.

All operating systems come with a text based prompt that you can use to talk to your computer on a level between clicks and binary. This prompt has different names on different machines. On Windows, it is called the **Command Prompt**, on Macs, it is called the **Terminal**, and on Linux it is called the **shell** or **Bash**. 

Each type of shell has slight differences in its *shell-scripting* language. The one I will use is **bash**, and I recommend that you do the same for the following reasons: 

1) We will be speaking the same language.

2) Windows command prompt is not as powerful when it comes to installing new software and handling file permissions (more on both of these later).

3) Bash is the default shell you will see on many servers, cloud computing platforms, superclusters, etc. Knowing the basics of bash is the first step to running your code on computers many times faster than the one you are reading this on.

*Disclaimer*: Bash and the Mac Terminal are different flavors of the standard UNIX shell, so this lesson is probably also doable on a Mac (but I have not tested this). I highly reccommend that you use a Linux distribution (e.g. Ubuntu) for this course (this course is developed and tested on Ubuntu 16.04).

If your computer is running Windows or OS X, see below for how to get a bash shell on your computer.
