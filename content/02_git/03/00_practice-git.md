# Practicing Git IRL

In this section we will learn about the process of open-source development and how to contribute to existing projects on GitHub with Git.

## Contributing

Often when we use a piece of software, there may be a feature we need but doesn't exists yet. Or maybe we find a bug that we need to fix to use the code in our work but the busy project owner tells us to fix it ourselves and open a **pull request**. In this chapter we will practice making pull requests (requests for an owner of a repository to *pull* our code into its main codebase).

Before contributing to a project on GitHub it is best practice to read the project README and the CONTRIBUTING guidelines, generally in the top level of the repository on GitHub.

We will start our practice with a simple text contribution (you only need to type your name!) to a practice repository called Plutopy.
