# What is PEP 8

PEP 8 is a collection of community coding guidelines for writing Python code. You can find more info about it at the official website [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

Many of these guidelines are more advanced than we will need in this course, but if ever you are curious about community-accepted ways to style your Python code, it's always good to brush up on some PEP8!
