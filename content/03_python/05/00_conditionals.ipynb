Each conditional takes a *boolean expression* and decides what to do based on whether the expression is `True` or `False`.\n\n## If statements\n\nIf statements allow you to change the execution of your code based on whether or not a condition is met. They consist of a **condition** (the boolean expression) and a **clause** (the stuff to do if the condition is `True`).\n\nIf statements will often use **comparison operators** like `==` (is equal to) to determine whether the following code is run.\n\nThe if statement follows the following form:\n\n```Python\nif 'something' == 'something else':\n    # this is the clause that is run if the condition is true\n    # it will run this code\n    # and everything else indented here\n# This un-indented code is no longer part of the clause\n# It runs regardless of whether the if block was run\n```\n\nChange the value of mynum in the following example to see what happens when an if statement is False. When mynum is not 5, is the print statement exectued?\n\n"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"mynum = 5\n\nif mynum == 5:\n    print('My number is 5')"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## if, elif, else statements\n","\n","Additional clauses can be added to the if statement to modify its behaviour in other cases. \n","\n","The `elif` statement will run its clause if the previous condition(s) were not met, but this additional condition *is* met.\n","\n","The `else` statement will run its clause if none of the preceeding if and elif statements have their conditions met.
