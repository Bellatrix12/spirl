# Scientific Programming IRL

This textbook is an introduction to scientific programming concepts for beginner programmers, newcomers to Python, and experts looking for a refresher. The book covers concepts from basic Python syntax through to distributing tested, version controlled code.

## Why another learn-to-code resource?

Most existing resources are scattered and contain a lot of programmer jargon. We wanted to compile some of the most useful scientific programming concepts into one easily accessible resource that busy scientists can learn in bite-sized chunks and refer back to when the need arises.

## How does it work?

In this book, you will see a mix of text, code examples, and interactive code blocks. While you could read the descriptions and grasp most concepts, the best way to learn programming concepts is to actually write some code! It's encouraged to run the code examples in the browser or on your own machine to build your programming chops.
