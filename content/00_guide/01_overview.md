# Scientific Programming IRL

This textbook is a collection of scientific programming concepts and practical examples for all scientists who code. It can be followed in order as a crash course in scientific programming, or used as a reference for specific topics.

## Why another learn-to-code resource?

Many "basic" programming courses contain a lot of programmer jargon, and sometimes StackOverflow just doesn't cut it. We wanted to bring practical scientific programming concepts into one easy-to-read resource that is accessible in a pinch.

## How does it work?

You can work through this textbook as a programming short course by following the [schedule](./02_schedule). Alternatively, you can use the navigation bar on the left or [search](../search) for the concept you want to learn about. Can't find what you're looking for? Make a suggestion on the [issues board](https://github.com/cjtu/spirl/issues)!

## Code is a language...

and languages take practice! In this book, you will see a mix of text, code examples, and interactive code blocks. The best way to learn programming is to practice reading, writing and running code. Follow along with the interactive code blocks, try the exercises and don't be afraid to explore and try new things!
