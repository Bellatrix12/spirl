# Welcome to SpIRL

The Scientific Programming In Real Life course is an introduction to core concepts for scientists to get started with programming in Python. The textbook is free and available at [cjtu.github.io/spirl].

## The Textbook

This repository contains the SpIRL which provides a combination of explanations, helpful links and interactive examples for learning scientific programming concepts. For more info on how the textbook was made and to get your own template, check out [Jupyterbook](https://jupyter.org/jupyter-book/intro.html).

## The course

The SpIRL textbook supports a scientific programming short course run at Northern Arizona University in Fall 2019. The schedule for the course can be found [here](https://cjtu.github.io/spirl/00_guide/02_schedule). More sections of the textbook will become available as the course progresses.
